# Exero

An app that extracts the source files from a NextJS website and orders them in a file manager.

It can be used to give context back to the webpack compiled version of the sources so that it will become readable after a while.

I don't know if there are any tools like this, hence why I decided to make this myself.

I initially created this app to extract Geoguessr's website source, and I don't know if the metadata file that they have exists on any other nextjs websites.

Regardless, you can use this app for your own websites.
